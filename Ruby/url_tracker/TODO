Things Yet To Be Done
=====================

* Use libnotify (or Notifier) when a change in a page is detected

* A Client can only send one message to a running server, since the server
  does not keep a pool of connections, relying on SocketCommunication. Implement
  a pool of connections is adequate, and even a MAX_CONN_QUEUE constant is defined
  for socket method calls purposes.

* Maybe refactor the SocketCommunication module, divinding it into client
  and server methods. Right now the code is a little convoluted due to the
  bind/connect duality.

* Study Celluloid, EventMachine is way too buggy. Could also be useful in the
  connection pooling.
